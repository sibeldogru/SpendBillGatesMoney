# 💸 Spend Bill Gates' Money (React Clone)

A fun React-based clone of the famous **neal.fun – Spend Bill Gates' Money** game.  
The goal of the application is to simulate spending Bill Gates’ $100,000,000,000 on imaginary products while dynamically tracking the remaining balance.

This project was built as a frontend exercise focusing on **React state management, component-based UI design, and responsive layout styling**.

## 🚀 Demo Concept

You start with **$100,000,000,000**.  
Each product has a fixed price.

- Buying a product decreases the balance
- Selling a product increases the balance
- You can only sell products you already own
- You cannot buy a product if you don’t have enough money
